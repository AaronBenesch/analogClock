# Analog Clock Project

This project is an analog clock  using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The clock displays the current time with hour, minute, and second hands.

## Assignment

We had to use javascript to program a clock that displays seconds, minutes and hours. We were given the index.html and were not allowed to change it - otherwise we could decide, what we wanted to do

## Features

- Clock showing the current time accurately with 3 hands displaying seconds, hours and minutes
- Responsive design for different screen sizes
- Smooth transitions for the clock hands

## Instructions to open clock

- Clone the repository.
- Run `index.html` in a web browser to view the clock.
